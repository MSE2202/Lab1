# DC Motor Wiring

The MSE 2202 Lab Kit includes two G12-N20-100 geared mini DC motors. These motors can operate over a wide voltage range (3–12 VDC) and are available with many different gear configurations. The particular version used in MSE 2202 turns at approximately 100 rpm when supplied with 6 VDC. An integrated Hall-effect quadrature encoder allows the rotation of the motor shaft to be measured. 

The motors are supplied with a 6-wire connector that terminates with bare wires. To facilitate a connection to the MX1508 DC Motor Driver, terminal wires need to be added to the 6-wire connector. 

## Instructions

The complete process of adding terminal connectors to the DC motor is demonstrated in the following video.

1. **Begin by putting on a pair of safety glasses.**

2. Start with a 6-wire female–female connector and cut it in half.

3. Strip about 2 mm of insulation from ends of the 12 wires and tin the ends. Tinning is the process of heating the wire end and applying a small amount of solder to fully coat the wire.

4. Shorten the ends of the two 6-wire motor connectors to 2–3 mm and tin the ends.

5. Cut the blue heat shrink tubing into 12 5 mm pieces and place one piece on each of the 12 motor connector wires. Slide the tubing towards the white connector. Confirm that each wire has a piece of heat shrink on it. 

6. Align the 6-wire motor connector wires with the 6-wire female connector wires. Solder each pair of wires together. Repeat with the other motor connector and female connector wires.

7. Slide the pieces of heat shrink tubing to fully cover the solder joints. Carefully apply heat (ideally with a heat gun, but a lighter could also be used—with caution!) to shrink the tubing around the wires.

8. Align the tab on the motor connector wire with the slot on the DC motor and carefully insert the connector. Repeat for the second motor.

9. **Be sure to wash your hands after handling solder.**
